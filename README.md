# Project_1_BlackJack

I will be creating the game of BlackJack. The game will be for one player vs the computer (who will be the dealer). The game will start where the dealer deals the player one face up card, then themselves a face down card. Then the player will recieve one face down card and the dealer will recieve their face up card. The goal of the game is to take the numerical value of your cards and try to get as close to 21 as possible. The Player will start their turn after they recieve their cards. Depending on the cards in their hands they will determine wether or not to "hit" or "stay". There are three ways to win. One is to beat the dealer by having the sum of your hand being eaul to or closer to 21 than the dealr. Another win is getting dealt a jack of spades, and an ace (which is BlackJack). Finally the last way to win is the dealer 'busting' (having their sum of cards exceeding 21)

goals:
To create a a fulldeck of playing cards
To randomize the dealing of those cards
To create a turn based game
To create winning and losing functions for the card game.
To create prompts to allow the user to make a selection to hit/stay
to create a display of the cards for the player seperate from the game table
To create a game/card table


Stretch goals:
to create multiplayer functionality
to create chips, and a betting system (scoring)
to creat AI for the dealer to determine their own choices upon their turn
